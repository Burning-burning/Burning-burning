Introduction
==================
Purpose
------------------
| In the past 10 years, no new gene therapy clinical trials have been approved in China, and there are no international multi center clinical trials in the field of gene therapy.The reason for this is that the transformation of scientific research in China is still relatively backward, and the early cost of the new field of gene therapy is very huge, and it may be abandoned. Even Introgen, the leader of this field, had to file for bankruptcy protection because FDA did not recognize its P53 gene therapy phase III clinical trial results.
| Thereforeï¼Œwe want to design a software to reduce the cost of gene therapy, and promote the development of gene therapy.
Overview
------------------
| Input the detailed information and parameters of the patient's target cells in the software to map out the patient's target cells, and match the better gene therapy sequence by simulating the survival of the patient's target cells.
